# syntaxes are the grammer of a programming language.
# we cannot mess up these syntaxes

# A important syntx rule in python is indentation for a code block

#studentinformation ---snake case 
#student_information ---camel case

# to create a variable we prefer camel case
# to create a function we prefer  snake case
